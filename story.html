					MY STORY
				</h3>
				<div class="paragraph">

					<p>
						I first learned coding back in Secondary School in 2002 and I was hooked instantly. I started with HTML and then learned Delphi, where we programmed a few little network games which was great fun. The idea of building something that people can interact with and that works is just so inspiring. I took Computing as a main subject for my Abitur (A-level equivalent in Germany) and achieved the highest mark.

						I then spent a few years following other interests - working as a judo-coach, completing a Bachelor in History of Art and finally training as a Primary School teacher in 2012. I worked in a number of different primary schools in London and Bristol, teaching English, Maths and the basics of coding to children from age 7-11. There, whilst teaching concepts on scratch and python, I rediscovered my passion for programming.

					<p>
						I decided to stop teaching in schools and started to spend more time programming again, whilst earning money as an online German Tutor. I first learned python properly with an online course, then retaught myself HTML 5 and CSS 3. Next I completed Harvard University's CS50 course - a 10 weeks introduction to Computer Science which covered a great many topics from memory usage to data structures. I learned the basics of JavaScript and SQL and the course culminated in my final project - <a href="ttcoach.html">Times Table Coach</a>. Now I am continuing the journey by starting with Harvard's CS50 web programming course and in the meantime looking for an entry-level job somewhere in the world of software or web-development.
